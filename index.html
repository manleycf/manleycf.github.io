<h1>Christopher Manley ePortfolio</h1>
<p>Welcome to my ePortfolio. I have included some projects and analysis to demonstrate my skills and abilities. Please enjoy!</p>
<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    My time in the Southern New Hampshire Computer Science program has helped me refine my skills and develop my goals. 
    Some of my earliest progress was in soft skills, cultivated through the exploration of effective communication in a professional setting. 
    Software Development Lifecycle also taught me the benefits of properly implementing Agile methodologies through the use of Scrum.
    In my projects for System Analysis and Design, I demonstrated an ability to successfully communicate technical concepts to a diverse audience that includes non-technical listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, these soft skills were developed in conjunction with the hard skills that are demonstrated here in this portfolio.
    My application of algorithmic principles to solve problems was honed and showcased by my work for Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design.
    These skills work well in conjunction with my experience building and working with databases in various courses, such as Introduction to Structured Database Environments, Client/Server Development, and Full Stack Development I & II.
    I have also practiced skills pertaining to software engineering throughout the entire software development lifecycle.
    In UI/UX Design and Development I demonstrated an ability to understand and employ valuable design techniques that contribute to user-friendly applications.
    Software Security allowed me to show my ability to consider security throughout the development process to ensure security is consistently worked into a project.
  </p>
  <p>
    This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate the technical skills I have developed during my time as a Computer Science student.
    I have selected three projects completed as coursework for two classes. These projects were then enhanced to facilitate the demonstration of my skills have improved since they were created.
    These three artifacts showcase my skills pertaining to software design/development, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
    The first artifact was enhanced twice, first to showcase my design/development skills, and again to show my database abilities.
    The remaining artifact will demonstrate my ability to apply algorithmic principles using my knowledge of data structures to effectively and efficiently problem-solve.

<h2>Project 1 - Android Inventory App</h2>
  <p>
    The first artifact I selected to enhance is an Android app created in CS 360. The app is an inventory system that allows users to store inventory information for easy access.
    It was created in October 2024. The primary functions of the app are displaying, adding, editing, and deleting inventory items. I selected this artifact for two main reasons.
    First, it has been seven months since it was created, which means my skills have improved since then and I would be able to identify weaknesses in the program.
    The other reason is that I believe it provides a good platform to demonstrate my technical skills as they pertain to software design and engineering.
    The login system demonstrates my ability to consider security as part of my development process (particularly after the enhancement).
    The use of the database within the app allows me to demonstrate my ability to write code that allows users to interact with a simple interface instead of a complex database.
    The enhancement I performed on this artifact is a language transfer. The original application was written in Java, with XML formatting. I rewrote it in Kotlin with Compose formatting.
    I also fixed an issue with the login system that allowed all users to interact with the same items, defeating the purpose of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary course outcome I intended to meet with this enhancement was, “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices 
    for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.” I believe I met this outcome through my work on this artifact. 
    By rewriting the application in Kotlin (Google’s preferred language for Android development), I demonstrated an ability to use current industry standards and trends to accomplish a goal that delivers value.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I was working through the enhancement of this artifact, the biggest challenge I faced was my limited familiarity with Kotlin.
    I had very little experience with the language prior to this enhancement, so I had to spend some time beforehand learning the relevant parts of the language.
    In addition, I had never used Compose to format the user interface, so I had to learn how to do that. There were many points where I felt completely lost, but I was always able to break down my problem and find a solution.
    Thankfully, I was able to use the XML files as a reference so I knew what I wanted the end product to look like.

<h2>Project 2 - College Course Binary Search Tree</h2>
  <p>
    The artifact I chose to enhance is a program that holds a college’s course listings in a Binary Search Tree. The program was written for CS 300 in February 2024.
    Written in C++, the program allows users to load course listings from a CSV file, print the entire tree, and search for a specific course number.
    I selected this project for enhancement because I believed it would allow me to demonstrate some specific skills pertaining to algorithms and data structures.
    First, it would allow me to consider the advantages and disadvantages of converting it from an unbalanced tree into a balanced AVL tree.
    The AVL tree is more complicated than the standard unbalanced tree, but it allows for more consistent efficiency.
    I also converted the program from C++ to Python to demonstrate my ability to grasp the concepts of the data structure in multiple languages.
    Finally, I separated the code into multiple files to make it more maintainable and easier to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had two course outcomes in mind when I selected this enhancement in Module One.
    These were, “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science,”
    and “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while
    managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” I believe the first was demonstrated in converting the program to Python.
    Python is a common language that is very readable and accessible, allowing collaboration from people with various experiences and backgrounds.
    The second course outcome was demonstrated in my switching to an AVL tree. The AVL tree is more consistently efficient but also more complex.
    I believe I successfully managed the trade-off of increased complexity to demonstrate its place in my design choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing I noticed when working on this enhancement was that my Python was a little rusty.
    So, to begin, I looked through some of my old Python projects to get the feel of the language back. Once I felt confident in my refresher, I started working through the program.
    Until researching for this enhancement, I had only briefly looked into AVL trees so I needed to get a better understanding of how exactly they worked.
    It took me a little time to wrap my head around some of the rotation logic (specifically left-right and right-left imbalances), but I successfully worked through it.

<h2>Project 3 - Android Inventory App (Database Enhancement)</h2>
  <p>
    The artifact I enhanced for the databases category is the same artifact I used for the software design and engineering enhancement.
    It is an inventory tracking application for Android, created for CS 360 in October 2024.
    The app is used to display and alter inventory items in a way that is convenient for the user.
    It was originally written in Java using XML formatting but had been re-written in Kotlin with Compose formatting for the first enhancement.
    I selected this artifact for enhancement because it allowed me to showcase my database skills.
    I added an inventory metrics screen that calculates and displays the total number of added items, edits performed, removed items, and total current quantity of items.
    I chose to perform this enhancement because I believe it demonstrates my ability to extract data from a database that can be used for decision making in a user-friendly manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary course outcome I intended to meet with this enhancement was, “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing
    practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.” I believe my work on this enhancement has met this outcome.
    I used my knowledge of database manipulation to calculate extra information that can be utilized in various different decision-making processes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My biggest challenge with this enhancement was deciding how I wanted to present extra information to the user.
    I had originally considered a graph, but after some thought and planning, I realized I preferred to give statistics.
    Once this decision was made, I had to work through what statistics may be useful for my users.
    One of the biggest things I learned throughout this process is that it is important to carefully consider every stage of the development process before you commit to a plan.
    I immediately started working through some code after deciding to do a chart, and I had to completely rework that section when I pivoted slightly.
    By slowing down and thinking more carefully, I could have made the process more efficient and easier for myself.
