<h1>Christopher Manley ePortfolio</h1>
<p>Welcome to my ePortfolio. I have included some projects and analysis to demonstrate my skills and abilities. Please enjoy!</p>
<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    My time in the Southern New Hampshire Computer Science program has helped me refine my skills and develop my goals. 
    Some of my earliest progress was in soft skills, cultivated through the exploration of effective communication in a professional setting. 
    Software Development Lifecycle also taught me the benefits of properly implementing Agile methodologies through the use of Scrum.
    In my projects for System Analysis and Design, I demonstrated an ability to successfully communicate technical concepts to a diverse audience that includes non-technical listeners.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, these soft skills were developed in conjunction with the hard skills that are demonstrated here in this portfolio.
    My application of algorithmic principles to solve problems was honed and showcased by my work for Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design.
    These skills work well in conjunction with my experience building and working with databases in various courses, such as Introduction to Structured Database Environments, Client/Server Development, and Full Stack Development I & II.
    I have also practiced skills pertaining to software engineering throughout the entire software development lifecycle.
    In UI/UX Design and Development I demonstrated an ability to understand and employ valuable design techniques that contribute to user-friendly applications.
    Software Security allowed me to show my ability to consider security throughout the development process to ensure security is consistently worked into a project.
  </p>
  <p>
    This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate the technical skills I have developed during my time as a Computer Science student.
    I have selected three projects completed as coursework for two classes. These projects were then enhanced to facilitate the demonstration of my skills have improved since they were created.
    These three artifacts showcase my skills pertaining to software design/development, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
    The first artifact was enhanced twice, first to showcase my design/development skills, and again to show my database abilities.
    The remaining artifact will demonstrate my ability to apply algorithmic principles using my knowledge of data structures to effectively and efficiently problem-solve.
